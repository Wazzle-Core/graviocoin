Graviocoin Core 0.1.6
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[Graviocoin Core](http://gravio.net/en/download) is the original Graviocoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Graviocoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Graviocoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/graviocoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/graviocoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run graviocoin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Graviocoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run Graviocoin-Core.
